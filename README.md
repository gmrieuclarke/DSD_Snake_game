# Digital Systems Design Snake Game Project

## Overview
This repository contains the final project for my Digital System Design course, where I spent the semester learning how to create and implement code on an FPGA board.

## Components
In this project, the following components were used:
- Combinational logic design  
  - Logic gates  
  - Multiplexers
- Sequential logic design  
  - Latches and flip-flops  
  - Registers  
  - Counters

## Topics
The following  were covered:
- Desiging for VGA Displays
- Finite State Machines (FSMs)  
- Clocking, reset strategies, and timing concepts  
- Testbenches and simulation

## Tools & Technologies
- **Language:** Verilog HDL  
- **Simulation Tools:** Vivado
- **Target Platform:** Basys3 Artix-7 FPGA Board
